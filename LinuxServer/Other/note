NOTES:
service file belongs in:/etc/systemd/system/ directory
executable cannot be run in /home or /root directory. Put it in /usr/local/bin/ to be safe as stated in the service file.
Test putting config file in same directory and stating full path for config file

Load Testing:
to compile: gcc -W -o loadTester -fopenmp loadTest.c
to run: ./loadTester <host> <port> <num_clients>
attempted 9000 clients from 2 machines totalling 18000
fails to accept new clients at around 10000 ~ 11000

Other Test 1 (Linux to Linux encryption):
Authenticate, USE documents directory, SEND a file, USE to main directory, GET a file

DEMO:
1. Open logging file
2. Edit the config file to have an extra expired directory that will be unable to be seen by both machines
3. start wireshark
4. systemctl start adminShareServer
5. Block 1 machine and have the other one not blocked
6. attempt to connect to the server with both machines
7. the machine that is not blacklisted will successfully authenticate and timeout
8. try to connect again with that machine and fail authentication causing block
9. attempt to connect after being blocked
10. edit the config file to unblacklist the other machine and systemctl restart
11. edit the config file to set timeouts to none
12. connect to the server with both client machines
For each machine:
13. GET a file from the main directory
14. Attempt to send a file to the main directory (fail)
15. USE a directory
16. SEND the file into that directory (success)
17. DELETE a file in the directory (One machine should lack delete priviliges)
18. Navigate back up to the parent directory
19. clients both exit
------
20. systemctl stop adminShareServer
21. show wireshark encryption
